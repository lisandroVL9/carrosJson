    <b>If get you to hear me now</b>
<strong> you'll get stronger
When you get older, oh
Just don't shrug your shoulders
When you get older
Things aren't easy
So just believe me now</strong>
<i>If you don't keep it cool now
You'll never make a sound
All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now
All the fears will fade away</i>
<mark>If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now</mark>
<small>Leave excuses aside</small>
<del>out your mind, oh
And don't let in slide</del>
<ins>You're not always right, no
Things aren't easy
So just you believe me now
Don't learn the hard way
Just let me show you how
All the lights will guide the way
If you get to hear me now</ins>
<sub>All the fears will fade away</sub>
<sup>If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now
If you get to hear me now</sup>
